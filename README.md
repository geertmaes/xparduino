Test setup XP days

TO DO:
 - Add README (/)
 - Add GitIgnore (/)
 - Clean up repo (/)
 - Hello World (Java) (/)
 - Hello World (Arduino) (/)
 - Get basic event flow going (x)
 - Arduino STUB (x)

<h3>Arduino libraries</h3>
For components like IR led and servo motors we will have to use external libraries which I will link here. You need to add them to your arduino IDE (which ever you are using), to be able to import them into your arduino source file. 
 
- For LEGO powerfunctions: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=89310.0
- For servo motors: TO DO (it exists, but I need to search for it).

<h3>Useful information</h3>
    
Thoughts:
- Every sensor/actor on the arduino will be connected to a port for it's signal
